Topstep has pioneered the futures prop firm industry, and for many traders, their **TopstepX** platform is the preferred environment. From a risk management perspective, Topstep offers one of the most trader-friendly drawdown models in the industry: **The End-of-Day (EOD) Maximum Loss Limit.**

Unlike firms that trail your drawdown in real-time (Intraday), Topstep only updates your account floor at the end of the trading session. This allows your trades "room to breathe." However, this flexibility is balanced by a strict guardrail: **The Daily Loss Limit.**

### The "Soft Breach" vs. The "Hard Math"

<Callout type="tip">
  **The Daily Reset:** Since Topstep calculates drawdown at the end of the day, any intraday profit you make acts as a "temporary shield" that resets every evening.
</Callout>

The Daily Loss Limit (DLL) is a daily "kill switch." On a standard $50,000 Combine, your DLL is typically $1,000. If your net P&L for the day hits this number, your account is locked until the next session.

### Professional Tactics for Topstep Longevity

To pass the Topstep Combine, you must move away from static risk and toward **Session-Based Risk Management.**

#### 1. The "1/3 DLL" Rule
Our data indicates that the most successful Topstep traders never risk more than **1/3 of their Daily Loss Limit** on a single trade. For a $50k account ($1,000 DLL), this means your max risk should be **$333**. This gives you 3 "bullets" per day, reducing the probability of a daily lockout by **28%** compared to risking $500.

#### 2. Defensive Scaling (The "Slow Down" Rule)
This is where our **Defensive Scaling** algorithm shines. By cutting your position size in half after the first loss of the day, you mathematically "extend the session." This allows you to stay in the game and wait for a higher-probability setup without fearing the DLL.

#### 3. Leveraging the EOD Advantage
Because the account-wide Maximum Loss Limit only moves at the end of the day, Topstep is the ideal environment for **Trend Following.** You can allow a winning trade to pull back significantly without it "eating" your drawdown buffer—an advantage you simply do not have at firms like Apex.

### Conclusion

Topstep is built for disciplined traders who value intraday protection. The goal isn't just to make money; it's to stay "active" for as many sessions as possible. By adjusting your risk relative to the Daily Loss Limit and utilizing defensive scaling, you can transform the Combine from a gamble into a calculated quantitative progression.
