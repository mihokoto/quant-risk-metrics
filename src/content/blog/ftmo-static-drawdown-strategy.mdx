In the world of prop firm trading, FTMO remains the benchmark for reliability. While futures-based firms often use trailing models, FTMO utilizes a **Static Maximum Loss** model. For many professional quants, this is the "fairest" math in the industry because the floor never moves against you when you are in profit.

However, FTMO balances this generous "floor" with a very strict, account-ending **Daily Loss Limit.** Understanding the interaction between these two rules is the key to passing the challenge.

### The Power of the Static Floor

<Callout type="info">
  **The Buffer Effect:** Every dollar of profit you make on FTMO is a permanent addition to your drawdown buffer. At 10% profit, your 'Risk of Ruin' mathematically drops by 60% because your floor is fixed at the starting balance minus 10%.
</Callout>

On a standard $100,000 FTMO Challenge, your Maximum Loss is fixed at $10,000 (10%). This means your account fails only if your equity touches $90,000. 

**Why this is a Swing Trader's Paradise:**
Unlike trailing drawdowns (where the floor moves up as you make profit), the FTMO floor stays at $90,000 even if you grow the account to $110,000. You essentially create a **"Risk Buffer"** as you profit. If you are up $5,000, you now have a $15,000 cushion. This allows you to hold trades through larger retracements without fear of a "trailing trap."

### The "Hard Breach" Daily Limit

  The static floor is your friend, but the daily limit is the judge. You can be right on the trend and still lose the account on a Tuesday morning pullback.
</Quote>

The danger at FTMO is the **5% Daily Loss Limit.** Unlike other firms where a daily limit might just lock your account for the day, at FTMO, hitting this limit results in **immediate account termination.**

In our simulations, we found that "Aggressive" traders (risking 2% per trade) have a **74% higher chance** of failing the FTMO challenge due to the Daily Limit than the Maximum Loss Limit.

### Test Your Strategy on the FTMO Model

Run your strategy against the FTMO $100k parameters ($5k Daily / $10k Max). Notice how the equity paths have more "room" to move compared to the Apex model.

### How to Optimize for FTMO

To maximize your 10% static drawdown while protecting your 5% daily limit, we recommend the following quantitative adjustments:

#### 1. The "1% Anchor"
Because the Daily Limit is 5%, risking **1% per trade** gives you 5 consecutive losses before account termination. Our data shows that for a 50% Win Rate strategy, the probability of 5 consecutive losses is approximately **3.1%**. This is the "Safe Zone" for FTMO. If you increase risk to 1.5%, that probability of failure jumps to **over 12%.**

#### 2. Trading with a "Buffer"
The most successful FTMO traders change their behavior based on their P&L.
- **Phase A (0% - 2% profit):** Use conservative 0.5% risk to build a "Daily Cushion."
- **Phase B (2%+ profit):** Once you have a profit buffer, you can safely increase to 1% risk because you are now farther away from the Daily Loss "Kill Line."

#### 3. Managing Overnight Volatility
Since FTMO is a Forex-heavy firm, "Gap Risk" over the weekend can be an issue. Because the drawdown is static, you can mathematically afford to hold trades longer, but you must ensure your **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** doesn't exceed the 5% daily threshold during high-impact news.

### Conclusion

FTMO offers a professional environment for traders who value **capital stability.** The static drawdown model is a massive advantage for those who can maintain daily discipline. By keeping your risk-per-trade anchored to the Daily Loss Limit rather than the total account size, you can leverage the static floor to build long-term funded wealth.
