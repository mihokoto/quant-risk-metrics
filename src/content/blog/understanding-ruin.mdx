Trading is a game of probabilities, not certainties. Most retail traders obsess over their "Strategy" — the entry model, the indicators, the setup. But institutional desks obsess over something else entirely: **Survival**.

  Survival is the only metric that matters. A profitable trader who goes broke is still broke.

In the world of Prop Firms (like Apex, FTMO, Topstep), survival is even harder because of the **Drawdown Limit**. You don't have $50,000 of room; you usually only have $2,500.

## Interactive Analysis
<QuantBadge />

Let's look at the math. Below is a live Monte Carlo simulator running 1,000 simulations of an **Apex 50k** evaluation account.

  **The Ruin Threshold:** Once your account equity drops below 50% of your allowed drawdown, your survival probability decreases exponentially, not linearly.

### The Trap of High Risk
Try moving the "Risk Per Trade" slider above to **2.0%**. 

Even with a 40% Win Rate (which is standard for high R:R strategies), risking 2% per trade on a $2,500 drawdown buffer is suicidal. The **Ruin Probability** likely jumps to over 60-80%.

### The Mathematical Solution
To survive a strict drawdown, you must inverse the math:
1.  **Lower Risk**: 0.5% to 0.75% is the sweet spot.
2.  **Increase Frequency**: Take more trades at lower size to let the "Law of Large Numbers" play out.

If you don't respect the math, the math won't respect your account.
